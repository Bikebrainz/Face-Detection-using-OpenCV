# Face-Detection-using-OpenCV
Before running this program, ensure you have:

    OpenCV installed in your system.
    A face cascade file named "haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml". This can usually be found in the data/haarcascades/ directory of your OpenCV installation, or it can be downloaded from the OpenCV GitHub repository.
    An image file named "test_image.jpg" in the same directory as your program, containing the faces you want to detect.

This program will open the image, convert it to grayscale, and then use the Haar cascade classifier to detect faces. Detected faces will be outlined with blue rectangles.
